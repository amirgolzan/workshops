# Workshop Outlines

> Dates and registration details available at [https://csc.ok.ubc.ca/workshops/](https://csc.ok.ubc.ca/workshops/)

## R Fundamentals for Data Analysis

This series of introductory workshops are intended for individuals with little to no familiarity with R or similar tools that rely on a scripted environment. They are intended as a low barrier entry into the world of using your computer to engage with data outside of graphical tools like Excel or SPSS.

## Python Basics for Data Analysis

This series of introductory workshops are intended for individuals with little to no familiarity with Python or similar tools that rely on a scripted environment. They are intended as a low barrier entry into the world of using your computer to engage with data outside of graphical tools like Excel or SPSS.

## Statistical Fundamentals: A Visual Approach

This series will use R and Python to help develop an intuition for fundamental statistical concepts using data visualization. These workshops are equally suitable to those hoping to enhance their ability to interpret common statistical tests and concepts as it is for those applying statistical modelling to their work. No background in statistics is required, but some familiarity with R or Python will be advantageous. 

You may wish to review the asynchronous content of either [R Fundamentals for Data Anlysis](https://csc-ubc-okanagan.github.io/workshops/#r-fundamentals-for-data-analysis) or [Python Basics for Data Analysis](https://csc-ubc-okanagan.github.io/workshops/#python-basics-for-data-analysis), or keep an eye out for the next time these workshops are offered.

## Fitting Models to Data Not Data to Models

You might have heard someone say that "all models are wrong, but some are useful". The best way to ensure models are useful is to choose a model that is appropriate to your data and research questions, rather than forcing your data to fit your model's assumptions (e.g., normality, independence, constant variance).

This series introduces early-career researchers to statistical models that extend beyond linear models (i.e., ANOVAs) so that they may learn how to *fit models to their data rather than fitting their data to models*. All workshops will use `R` and RStudio, so some experience with `R` or other programming languages is encouraged but not required. See the [R Fundamentals for Data Anlysis](https://csc-ubc-okanagan.github.io/workshops/#r-fundamentals-for-data-analysis) for an introduction to `R` and RStudio. Attendees who do not have experience with `R` are encouraged to review this content or take the introductory workshop concurrently if it's being offered.
