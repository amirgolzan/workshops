R is great for interactive computational analysis, allowing for easy exploration and iteration. Using an IDE - Integrated Development Environment - such as RStudio, facilitates this interactivity, providing you with easy access to a place to quickly code (the console), a place to write saveable scripts (source editor), a place to view the objects that you create (environment pane), and a place to interact with your file system, visual outputs from your code, and help documentation (the miscellaneous pane, for lack of a better word).
