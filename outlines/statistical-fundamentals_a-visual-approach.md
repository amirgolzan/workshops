## Statistical Fundamentals: A Visual Approach

This series will use R and Python to help develop an intuition for fundamental statistical concepts using data visualization. These workshops are equally suitable to those hoping to enhance their ability to interpret common statistical tests and concepts as it is for those applying statistical modelling to their work. No background in statistics is required, but some familiarity with R or Python will be advantageous. 

You may wish to review the asynchronous content of either [R Fundamentals for Data Anlysis](https://csc-ubc-okanagan.github.io/workshops/#r-fundamentals-for-data-analysis) or [Python Basics for Data Analysis](https://csc-ubc-okanagan.github.io/workshops/#python-basics-for-data-analysis), or keep an eye out for the next time these workshops are offered.

**Population, Sampling, Sampling Distribution, and Central Limit Theorem**

This session will introduce participants to the foundational concepts of statistical inference, including population distributions and the process of random sampling. Attendees will learn how sampling distributions evolve towards normality as sample sizes increase and will visually explore the Central Limit Theorem.

By the end of the session, participants should be able to visualize and understand population distributions, illustrate random sampling processes, recognize the normalizing effect of larger samples on sampling distributions, and demonstrate the Central Limit Theorem visually.

**Visualizing Errors and Common Pitfalls**

This session will address the visualization of standard deviation (s.d.), standard error of the mean (s.e.m.), and confidence interval (CI) error bars to enhance the understanding of uncertainty in data analysis. The interpretation of error bars for statistical significance will be discussed, along with common misinterpretations to avoid.

By the end of the session, participants should be able to visualize and interpret error bars, understand the implications of their spacing and width, and be cautious of common pitfalls such as misinterpreting non-overlapping error bars as evidence of significance.

**P value, Significance, and T-test**

This session will introduce participants to the concept of P values and their role in hypothesis testing, highlighting that P values reflect the probability of observing the data under the null hypothesis, not the biological significance of the findings. The session will cover the computation of P values and delve into the nuances of one-sample t-tests.

By the end of the session, participants should be able to comprehend the meaning of P values, understand how hypothesis tests calculate P values, recognize when small P values indicate unlikely events under the null hypothesis, and explore the assumptions behind one-sample t-tests.

**Visualizing samples with Boxplots: Kick the Bar chart habit**

This session will address the advantages of box plots over bar charts for displaying the spread and variability in data. Participants will learn how box plots can be used to compare multiple samples, the impact of sample size on data representation, and the efficient identification of outliers.

By the end of the session, participants should be able to create and interpret box plots, appreciate their usefulness in comparing multiple samples, understand the implications of sample size, and identify outliers and median confidence intervals through notches in box plots.


**All about t-tests and visualizations**

This session will introduce participants to the various types of t-tests, including one-sample, two-sample, paired, and one-sided tests. Attendees will learn about the appropriate applications for each type and the visualization techniques that can enhance the interpretation of t-test results.

By the end of the session, participants should be able to apply and visually represent different t-tests, interpret their results, understand the implications of multiple testing corrections, and select the appropriate test for their data.

**Non-parametric tests and visualizations**

This session will introduce participants to non-parametric tests, which are useful when data distributions do not meet the assumptions of parametric tests. Attendees will learn to compare the adaptability of these tests with different data distributions and to visualize their operation.

By the end of the session, participants should be able to choose and apply the appropriate non-parametric tests for their data, visualize the operation of these tests, and understand the challenges of multiple testing with non-parametric methods.

**ANOVA and Blocking**

This session will introduce participants to the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), a statistical method used for comparing the means of three or more groups. The concept of blocking will also be introduced to reduce noise and isolate sources of variation.

By the end of the session, participants should be able to use ANOVA for multi-treatment analysis, implement blocking in experimental design, calculate the F statistic for assessing significance, and appreciate how blocking can improve the efficiency of a study.

**Correlation, causation, and association**

This session will address the concepts of correlation, causation, and association in data. Participants will learn to differentiate between these concepts and to recognize and interpret various types of correlations.

By the end of the session, participants should be able to distinguish between correlation and causation, recognize the impact of confounding variables on associations, evaluate correlation reliability, and understand the significance of correlation results.
