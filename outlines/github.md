**Introduction to GitHub** 

When working on a project with multiple collaborators, issues can arise when people are working on the same document at the same time.  If the group has to take turns working individually, a lot of time can be lost waiting for the other to finish, but if they work on their own copies and share them back and forth, things can be lost, overwritten, or duplicated.

This is where automated version control can be valuable, which will prevent any updates or additions from ever being lost, will keep a record of whom made any changes, and will notify users when there is a conflict between one person’s work an another’s.  

This session will provide an introduction to GitHub, a version control software, and will cover the concept of automated version control, as well as basic GitHub functions including push, pull, branching, and others.  

By the end of this session, participants will gain familiarity with GitHub as a version control tool, and will set up a GitHub repository and be able to execute basic GitHub commands.
