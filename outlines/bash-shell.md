**Introduction to the Bash Shell pt. 1: Navigating Files and Directories**

This session is aimed at those who have little to no experience with the command line, and will begin by introducing the Unix Shell and its functions, and then will cover the basics of navigating files and directories.

By the end of this session, participants will become familiar with the command line interface and file paths, and will be able to execute Unix commands to navigate through the files and folders in their computers.

The command line interface can seem daunting to new users, but it is a very powerful tool that, with some foundational understanding, can be used for a number of different computational and data management tasks.

This session is the first of a two-part series on the Unix Shell, and is part of the larger Researcher Toolkit series, an eight-part series which aims to introduce participants to a variety of research tools and concepts, and build core competencies applicable across the research lifecycle. There is no obligation to take every course, but as some courses build on content from previous sessions, it is expected that you have sufficient knowledge of key concepts relevant to certain courses (any courses with pre-requisites will send participants links to necessary information).

**Introduction to the Bash Shell pt. 2: Working with Files and Directories**

This session will build up concepts covered in the Unix Shell pt. 1, and will shift to working with files and directories, focusing on how to create, edit, move, and remove files and directories.

By the end of this session, participants will be able to create, edit, move, and remove files and directories using Unix commands.
