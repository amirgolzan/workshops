**Research Data Management pt. 1 – The Basics** 

This session will begin by giving an introduction of core RDM concepts, and then will shift into how to manage your own files by exploring some best practices in file naming and structuring your folders.  

By the end of this session, participants will be familiar with fundamental concepts of RDM, and will be able to implement best practices in file naming and directory structures.

Research Data Management (RDM) is a key aspect of the research lifecycle. With the release of the Tri-Agencies’ Policy on Research Data Management, and the upcoming requirement of data management plans (DMPs) in Tri-Agency applications, it is more important than ever for researchers to implement RDM fundamentals.

This session is the first of a three-part series on RDM, and is part of the larger Researcher Toolkit series, an eight-part series which aims to introduce participants to a variety of research tools and concepts, and build core competencies applicable across the research lifecycle. There is no obligation to take every course, but as some courses build on content from previous sessions, it is expected that you have sufficient knowledge of key concepts relevant to certain courses (any courses with pre-requisites will send participants links to necessary information).

**Research Data Management pt. 2 – Documentation**

This session will build upon the concepts covered in RDM pt. 1, and will focus on the importance of making your work interpretable and reusable to others through documentation.  After covering why documentation is important for research materials, we will explore how to create README files as well as data dictionaries.

By the end of this session, participants will gain an understanding of how to make data interpretable and reusable, and will be able to create a README file and a data dictionary.

**Research Data Management pt. 3 – Data Management Plans (DMPS)**

This session will build upon concepts covered in RDM pt. 2 and 3, and will delve into the DMP Assistant, a Canadian tool for creating DMPs. We’ll walk through the sections of a DMP, and discuss questions and aspects to consider when planning a research project, to ensure that your data workflows and processes are purposeful and unnecessary disruptions are avoided.

By the end of this session, participants will be able to navigate the DMP Assistant and its various functions, and identify key questions and components of a DMP.
