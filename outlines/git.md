**Introduction to GitHub**

This session will provide an introduction to GitHub, a version control software, and will cover the concept of automated version control, as well as basic GitHub functions including push, pull, branching, and others.

By the end of this session, participants will gain familiarity with GitHub as a version control tool, and will set up a GitHub repository and be able to execute basic GitHub commands.

When working on a project with multiple collaborators, issues can arise when people are working on the same document at the same time. This is where automated version control can be valuable, which will prevent any updates or additions from ever being lost, will keep a record of whom made any changes, and will notify users when there is a conflict between one person’s work an another’s.

This session is the first of a three-part series on GitHub and GitHub pages, and is part of the larger Researcher Toolkit series, an eight-part series which aims to introduce participants to a variety of research tools and concepts, and build core competencies applicable across the research lifecycle. There is no obligation to take every course, but as some courses build on content from previous sessions, it is expected that you have sufficient knowledge of key concepts relevant to certain courses (any courses with pre-requisites will send participants links to necessary information).

**Introduction to GitHub Pages pt. 1**

Building on concepts covered in Introduction to GitHub and Introduction to the Unix Shell, this session will introduce GitHub pages as a way to create a personal website or blog, or create a website for your project. After introducing the concept of GitHub pages, we will then go through the steps of generating a GitPages website, and will introduce markdown as a way to add content to your pages, as well as how to push (save) content to the website.

By the end of this session, participants will be able to initiate a website on GitHub pages, and be able to add content to the website.

**Introduction to GitHub Pages pt. 2**

Building on concepts covered in Introduction to GitHub and Introduction to GitHub Pages pt. 1, this session will go deeper into the capabilities of GitHub pages, exploring how to implement themes to your pages and customizing content.

By the end of this session, participants will be able to customize the look and feel of a GitHub pages website.
