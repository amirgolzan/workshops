**Fundamental Concepts with [RStudio][Jupyter Notebook]**

This session will introduce participants to fundamental concepts in [R][Python] that will help them excel at more advanced applications. Topics covered include the application of simple math, core data types and structures, an overview of vector operations, and how to navigate getting help. [For Python, this will include data structures used in the pandas library]. The workshop will be run using [RStudio][Jupyter Notebook].

By the end of the session, participants should feel familar with [RStudio][Jupyter Notebook] as an environemnt for interactive analsysis in [R][Python], be able to identify and articulate use cases for common data structures, and know a few key ways to get additional help when they run into trouble.

**[R][Python]: Importing Data**

This session will address importing Excel and comma seperated value files into R for analysis. Topics covered include variable naming, variable assignment, missing values on import, assigning appropriate data types to variables, and saving data as R data objects.

By the end of the session, participants should be able to import data stored in tabular format (Excel, csv), standardize missing values for subsequent tidying and analysis.

**[R][Python]: Exploring Data**

This session will introduce participants to common tasks of initial data exploration. Topics covered include calculating missing values, basic summaries (quartiles, categories, counts, etc), single variable descriptive stats (range, length, variance, etc), and plotting distributions.

By the end of the session, participants should be able to use a suite of tools to comprehensivley describe their data and establish if it meets underlying criteria for subsequent analysis.

**[R][Python]: Subsetting Data**

This session will explore the variety of ways that data can be subset in [R][Python].  Working with data frames and vectors, data frames, and lists, participants will learn the nuances of extracting portions of a larger data set for analysis.

By the end of this session, participants will be proficient in extracting observartions, variables, and values from their data and be aware of when attributes of the extracted data will be lost or maintained for further analysis.

**[R][Python]: Iterating Over Data**

This session will revisit the vector underpinnings of [R][andas], introduce the apply() family of functions for iterating, or looping, over objects, and introduce for loops for those instances when no pre-existing solutiong exists.

By the end of this session, participants will be able to efficiently apply looped constructs to their data, using pre-existing tools in [R][pandas], and be familiar with the basics of constructing for loops to handle repeated tasks.

**[R][Python]: Conditions**

This session will introduce conditionals in [R][Python], addressing those times when, for example, if something is true *x* needs to happen, otherwise *y* needs to happen. Participants will be introduced to pre-exising if / else constructs (such as ifelse() and switch()), as well as how to construct conditional statments from scratch.

By the end of this session, participants will be able effectively implement simple if else constructs into the data analysis pipelines.

**R: TidyVerse**

This sesson will introduce particpants to the basics of tidyverse, a family of packages for R designed to facilitate the data analysis workflow. This session will cover common tasks in an analysis pipeline, including subsetting, splitting, merging, and reshaping data, along with pipe notation to simplify your code.

By the end of this session, participants will be able to undertake common base R tasks within TidyVerse, recognize some of the issues of using both base R and TidyVerse syntax and data structures, and be in a better position to choose the best approach in R for the data tasks they're tackling.

**[R][Python]: Data Visualization**

This session will introduce [ggplot][altair/plotnine/matplotlib] for data visualization. Common visualizations, including bar charts, histograms, scatterplots, etc will be covered.

By the end of this session participants will be able to build, annotate, and customize common data visualizations.

**[R][Python]: Generating Reports**

This session will introduce participants to RMarkdown, a powerful package for interweaving narrative text and data analysis to produce reports in html, pdf, html5 slides, etc. Using RStudio, RMarkdown, and the reticulate package, participants can conduct their analysis in R or Python.

By the end of this session, participants will be familiar with the requisite libraries and document structure to create beautiful, reproducible reports for distribution.
