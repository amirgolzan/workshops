```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      eval = TRUE)
```

We can also generate a count for the entire data frame, using `sapply()` which will run `sum()` across all of the columns [`tapply()` and the family of `apply()` functions will be covered in more detail in a later session.]

```{r}
sapply(data_gapminder, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```
