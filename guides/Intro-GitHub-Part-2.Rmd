# Introduction to Git and GitHub Part 2

Last Updated: `r Sys.Date()`

## Sharing Your Work

At the moment, our changes are only recorded locally, on our computer. If we wanted to work collaboratively with someone else they would have no way of seeing what we’ve done. We will fix that by using GitHub to share our work.

### Create a Repository on GitHub

Go to the [GitHub website](https://github.com/) and log in. To create a new repository, select the `+` icon in the upper-right corner of the page, and select **New Repository**.

---

Clicking `New Repository` will take you to a page with a lot of options to create a repository. For this workshop, we won't be using any of these options, but they are definitely worth exploring!

Name your new repository `my-first-repo`, to match the repository you created on your Desktop.

![](assets/images/new-repo.png)


GitHub will ask if you want to add a README.me file, a `.gitignore` file, or a license. Do not do any of that for now, as we'll be starting with a completely empty repository.

After naming the repository, click the `Create Repository` button.


## Connecting Your Local Repository to the GitHub Repository


The next page that GitHub displays contains some information to help you connect your repository on GitHub with your local repository (on your own computer). To make this connection, we want to tell our local repository that GitHub is the `remote` repository. In order to do that we need the information that GitHub displays in the “Quick setup” box on this page.

We will use the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol for this lesson, so please make sure that button shows that it is selected (gray highlight) and that the address in the text box starts with `git@github. It will look something like this:


![](assets/images/ssh.png)

Although SSH requires some additional configuration, it is a security protocol used in many applications. The steps below describe SSH at a minimum level for GitHub.

Right now, we have a local repository on our own computer, but ewe also have a newly crealy remote repository on GitHub.  At this point, the two are completely separate from each other, but we want to link them together to synchronize them and share our project.

To do this, we will use the commands provided by GitHub with the heading **"..or push to an existing repository from the command line."**


![](assets/images/push.png)

Let's move back to the shell, and enter the first command:

> $ git remote add origin git@github.com:yourname/my-first-repo.git

Make sure to use the URL for your actual repository user name rather than `yourname`: the only difference should be your username instead of `yourname`.

Let’s breakdown the elements of the command. All commands related to Git in the shell start by invoking the Git language by typing `git` at the start. `remote add` is the command in the Git language we use to configure a remote repository, e.g., another Git repository that contains the same content as our local repository, but that is not on our computer. `origin` is the nickname we’re telling our local machine to use to for the following long web address. After we enter this command, we can use `origin` to refer to this specific repository in GitHub instead of the URL.

We can check that it is setup correctly with the command:

> $ git remote -v

This should result in the following output:

>
> origin  git@github.com:<your_github_username>/hello-world.git (fetch)
> origin  git@github.com:<your_github_username>/hello-world.git (push)
>

### SSH Background and Setup

We still need to do a little more setup before we can actually connect to this remote repository. We need to set up a way for our local computer to authenticate with GitHub so that GitHub recognizes our computer as belonging to the same person who owns the GitHub repository.

We will use SSH as our authentication method. SSH stands for Secure SHell protocol. SSH is a cryptographic network protocol that allows secure communication between computers using an otherwise insecure network.

SSH uses what is called a key pair – two keys that work together to validate access. One key is used publicly (the public key) and the other key is kept private (the private key).

You can think of the public key as a padlock, and only you have the key (the private key) to open it. You use the public key where you want a secure method of communication, such as your GitHub account. You give this padlock, or public key, to GitHub and say “lock the communications to my account with this so that only computers that have my private key can unlock communications and send Git commands as my GitHub account.”

What we will do now is the minimum required to set up the SSH keys and add the public key to a GitHub account. I’m not going to lie, this is a bit tedious and confusing. But you have to do it to get to the fun part, so hang in there.

The first thing we are going to do is check if this has already been done on the computer you’re on.

To do this, we will run the `ls` command to check what key pairs already exist on your computer.  In our command we use the `~` as the shorthand for "my home directory."

> $ ls -al ~/.ssh

Your output is going to look a little different depending on whether or not SSH has ever been set up on the computer you are using.

If you have not set up SSH, your output might look like this:

>
> ls: cannot access '/c/Users/YourName/.ssh': No such file or directory
>

If SSH has been set up on the computer you’re using, the public and private key pairs will be listed. The file names are either `id_ed25519`/`id_ed25519.pub` or `id_rsa`/`id_rsa.pub` depending on how the key pairs were set up.

If you do not have SSH set up, let’s set it up now. Use this command to create key pairs:

> $ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "yourname@domain.name"

Output:

>
> Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
> Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/YourName/.ssh/id_ed25519):
>

Because we want to use the default file, you can just press `enter`

Output:

>
> Created directory '/c/Users/YourName/.ssh'.
> Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
>

Your computer is now asking you for a passphrase to protect this SSH key pair. We recommend that you use a passphrase and that you make a note of it. There is no “reset my password” option for this setup. If you forget your passphrase, you have to delete your existing key pair and do this setup again. It’s not a big deal, but easier if you don’t have to repeat it.

Output:

>
> Enter same passphrase again
>

After entering the passphrase a second time, you should receive this confirmation:

> 
> Your identification has been saved in /c/Users/YourName/.ssh/id_ed25519
> Your public key has been saved in /c/Users/YourName/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
> The key fingerprint is:
> SHA256:SMSPIStNyA00KPxuYu94KpZgRAYjgt9g4BA4kFy3g1o yourname@domain.name
> The key's randomart image is:
> +--[ED25519 256]--+
> |^B== o.          |
> |%*=.*.+          |
> |+=.E =.+         |
> | .=.+.o..        |
> |....  . S        |
> |.+ o             |
> |+ =              |
> |.o.o             |
> |oo+.             |
> +----[SHA256]-----+
>

The “identification” is actually the private key. You should never share it. The public key is appropriately named. The “key fingerprint” is a shorter version of a public key.

Now that we have generated the SSH keys, we will find the SSH files when we check.

> $ ls -al ~/.ssh

Output:

>
> drwxr-xr-x 1 YourName 197121   0 Month day time ./
> drwxr-xr-x 1 YourName 197121   0 Month day time ../
> -rw-r--r-- 1 YourName 197121 419 Month day time id_ed25519
> -rw-r--r-- 1 YourName 197121 106 Month day time id_ed25519.pub
>

Now we need to give our public key over to GitHub.

To start, we need to copy the public key. Be sure to include the `.pub` at the end, otherwise you're looking at the private key.

> $ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

Output:

>
> ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIDmRA3d51X0uu9wXek559gfn6UFNF69yZjChyBIU2qKI yourname@domain.name
>

Copy that entire line of output, and we will paste the copied text into GitHub in the next step.

Now, going to GitHub.com, click on your profile icon in the top right corner to get the drop-down menu. Click “Settings,” then on the settings page, click “SSH and GPG keys,” on the left side “Account settings” menu. Click the “New SSH key” button on the right side. Now, you can add the title (A person might use the title “2023 workshop,” just a little description to remind themselves which computer this public key connect to). Paste your SSH key into the field, and click the “Add SSH key” to complete the setup.

Now that we've set that up, let's check our authentication from the command line:

> $ ssh -T git@github

You'll be prompted to enter your passphrase, and then should get the following output:

> 
> Hi YourName! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
>

## Pushing Changes

Now we have established a connection between the two repositories, but we still haven’t synchronized their content, so the remote repository is still empty. To fix that, we will have to “push” our local changes to the GitHub repository. We do this using the `git push` command.  You may be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password to complete the command.

> $ git push -u origin main

Output:

>
> Counting objects: 3, done.
> Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 226 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
> Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
> To https://github.com/<your_github_username/hello-world
>  * [new branch]      main -> main
> Branch main set up to track remote branch main from origin.
>

The nickname of our remote repository is “origin” and the default local branch name is “main”. The `-u` flag tells git to remember the parameters, so that next time we can simply run `git push` and Git will know what to do.

When we do a `git push`, we will see Git ‘pushing’ changes upstream to GitHub. Because our file is very small, this won’t take long but if we had made a lot of changes or were adding a very large repository, we might have to wait a little longer. We can check where we’re at with `git status`:

> $ git status

Output:

>
> On branch main
> Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/main'.
> nothing to commit, working tree clean
>

Now let's go and add another line to our `readme.md` file.  I'm going to add, "And what a world it is!", but feel free to add whatever you'd like.

We can now use the `git diff` command to see changes we have made before making a commit.

> $ git diff

Output:

>
> diff --git a/readme.md b/readme.md
> index 3b18e51..4325e02 100644
> --- a/readme.md
> +++ b/readme.md
> @@ -1 +1,4 @@
> hello world
> +
> +and what a world it is!
>

The command produces lots of information and it can be a bit overwhelming at first, but let’s go through some key information here:

* The first line tells us that Git is producing output similar to the Unix diff command, comparing the old and new versions of the file.
* The second line tells exactly which versions of the file Git is comparing: `3b18e51` and `4325e02` are unique computer-generated identifiers for those versions.
* The third and fourth lines once again show the name of the file being changed.
* The remaining lines are the most interesting; they show us the actual differences and the lines on which they occur. In particular, the + markers in the first column show where we have added lines.


We can now commit these changes:

> $ git add readme.md
> $ git commit -m 'Add another line to readme.md'

If we are very forgetful and don't remember what we just did, we can use the `git log` command to look at what we've been doing with our git repository:

> $ git log

Output:

>
> commit b77335984aad66f77e28aa5cc2d31a7684b08f5e (HEAD -> main, origin/main)
> Author: Your Name <your_email>
> Date:   Fri Oct 27 09:41:35 2023 -0700
> 
>     Add another line to readme.md
>
> commit b77335984aad66f77e28aa5cc2d31a7684b08f5e (origin/main)
> Author: Nick Rochlin <nick.rochlin@ubc.ca>
> Date:   Fri Oct 27 09:34:42 2023 -0700
>
>    Add readme.md
>

This shows us the two commits we have made and shows the messages we wrote. It is important to try to use meaningful commit messages when we make changes. This is especially important when we are working with other people who might not be able to guess as easily what our short cryptic messages might mean. Note that it is best practice to always write commit messages in the imperative (e.g. ‘Add readme.md’, rather than ‘Adding readme.md’).


## Pushing Changes (again)

Now, let’s have a look at the repository at GitHub again (that is, `https://github.com/rochlinn/my-first-repo` with `rochlinn` replaced with your username). We see that the readme.md file is there, but there is only one commit:



![](assets/images/commit.png)


And if you click on `readme.md` you will see that it contains the line `Hello world!', but not the new line we just added.

This is because we haven’t yet pushed our local changes to the remote repository. This might seem like a mistake in design but it is often useful to make a lot of commits for small changes so you are able to make careful revisions later and you don’t necessarily want to push all these changes one by one.

Another benefit of this design is that you can make commits without being connected to internet.

But let's push our changes now, using the `git push` command:

> $ git push

Output:

>
> Enumerating objects: 5, done.
> Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
> Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 288 bytes | 288.00 KiB/s, done.
> Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
> To github.com:<your_github_username/my-first-repo.git
>   b773359..9d54345  main -> main
>

And now when we check GitHub, we can see there are now 2 commits.


## Pulling Changes

When working with others, or when we’re making our own changes from different machines, we need a way of pulling those remote changes back into our local copy. For now, we can see how this works by making a change on the GitHub website and then ‘pulling’ that change back to our computer.

Let’s go to our repository in GitHub and make a change. Underneath where our readme.md file is listed you will see a button to ‘Add a README’. Do this now, entering whatever you like, scrolling to the bottom and clicking ‘Commit new file’ (The default commit message will be ‘Create README.md’, which is fine for our purposes).

> For more information about README files, see the 
> [RDM Documentation](https://csc-ubc-okanagan.github.io/workshops/RDM_pt2-documentation.html) lesson.

Our local repository is now out of sync with our remote repository, so let’s fix that by pulling the remote changes into our local repository using the `git pull` command:

> $ git pull

> remote: Enumerating objects: 4, done.
> remote: Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
> remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
> Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), 655 bytes | 218.00 KiB/s, done.
> From github.com:<your_github_username/my-first-repo
>   9d54345..b701835  main       -> origin/main
> Updating 9d54345..b701835
>Fast-forward
> README.md | 1 +
> 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
> create mode 100644 README.md
>

You can now see that with the `ls` command that the README file is in your repository.

When we begin collaborating on more complex projects, we may have to consider more aspects of git functionality, but this should be a good start. Good luck on your git adventures!
